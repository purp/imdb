h2. Imdb: A simple ruby library to scrape IMDB

h3. Usage

<pre>
<code>
require 'Imdb'

movie = Imdb.find_movie_by_id('tt1099212')

puts "IMDB ID: #{movie.imdb_id}"
puts "Title: #{movie.title}"
puts "Rating: #{movie.rating}"
puts "Release Date: #{movie.release_date}"
puts "Tagline: #{movie.tagline}"
puts "Plot: #{movie.plot}"
puts "Runtime: #{movie.runtime}"
movie.directors.each do |director|
        puts "Director: #{director.name}"
end
movie.writers.each do |writer|
        puts "Writer: #{writer.name}"
end
movie.genres.each do |genre|
        puts "Genre: #{genre.name}"
end
puts "Poster URL: #{movie.poster_url}"
</code>
</pre>

Thats about all it does. its simple. I only made it to work with another project.
Thanks to 'We <} Code' for the jump start via http://www.weheartcode.com/2007/04/03/scraping-imdb-with-ruby-and-hpricot/


h3. Offenses I Hope To Perpetrate On This Fork, by purp

* *[DONE]* Refactor to use IMDB::Movie pattern while maintaining backward compatibility with ImdbMovie
* *[DONE]* Refactor tests to use local fixtures rather than require teh intarweb (too sloooooow and prone to transient errors)
* *[DONE]* Add a rakefile with tasks for spec and refreshing fixtures
* Make IMDB::Title object as base for IMDB::Movie
* Add IMDB::Series, IMDB::Episode using IMDB::Title as a base
* Add finders for all IMDB searches (title, name, char name, lookup, history/on this day, recent releases, and metasearch)
* Add IMDB::Game (with IMDB::Title as base) for completeness
* See if there is interesting work on other unmerged forks and, if so, pull it in
