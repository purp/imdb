Attributes for IMDB::Title subclasses

T = implemented in IMDB::Title

M = Movie definitely has it
m = Movie probably has it
S = Series definitely has it
s = Series probably has it
E = Episode definitely has it
e = Episode probably has it

... and when I get around to looking:
V = Video Game definitely has it
v = Video Game probably has it

* = not yet implemented

If not implemented in IMDB::Title, implementation belongs in this module:
  M S   IMDB::Title::Rated (crappy name, but it'll do for now)
  M   E IMDB::Title::Individual
    S E IMDB::Title::Episode
  M S E IMDB::Title::Timed
